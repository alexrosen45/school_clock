# school_clock
This is a clock that I completed for my computer science class. It displays the day and time at my school during the 2020-2021 school year. If you want this clock to work for your school or another school year you can update the columns and the data in the csv file called 'schedule.csv'. I will hopefully come up with an update for the application that includes local weather (which can be changed) and which period it is based on the time and the day.
